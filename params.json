{"name":"Octopush","tagline":"Open Source Octopush project","body":"### Welcome to Octopush project\r\nOctopush is a project born out of the necessity to orchestrate Our Jenkins Deployment pipeline at OLX. We started up connecting Jenkins CI Servers with Jenkins RM Server in order to keep things separate, clean and scalable. We needed to be able to request a Deployment automatically from a Jenkins CI Server (managed by a certain Dev Team) to the Release Management Jenkins (managed by RM Team) once the builds where OK. There is no native or pretty way of doing this, we just curl from one Jenkins to the other like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl --user $JENKINS_USER:$API_TOKEN \"http://jenkins-rm.olx.com/job/Deploy_Component/buildWithParameters?env=Staging&repo=CompX&revision=1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n```\r\nand checked out the response using Jenkins API like:\r\n```\r\ncurl \"http://jenkins-rm.olx.com/job/Deploy_Component/lastBuild/api/json\"\r\n```\r\nThis was ok for a while, but then we needed better arbitration and visibility on how to handle a long queue of awaiting components to deploy.\r\nThat's how Octopush was born.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Octopush Orchestration engine\r\nOctopush handles a Queue were every request waits for its turn to be deployed, available components to be deployed are configured on src/config/config.yml where you also specify a groupId. This groupId works as a tier identification, front-end components use one, backend use another. This is used by Octopush to identify dependecies and be able to parallelize non-dependant components (on the same group) and serialize dependant ones (This is an improvement point, dependency graph would be much better).\r\n\r\n### Jenkins integration\r\nFor Jenkins integration there are a couple of configuration parameters:\r\n```\r\njenkins:\r\n    host:     http://jenkins-rm.olx.com.ar\r\n    user:     jenkins-user\r\n    pass:     password\r\n    jobs: \r\n        prefix: 'Push_Staging_'\r\n        live.prefix: 'Push_LIVE_'\r\n        notifications: 'Octopush_Notification'\r\n```\r\nThe firsts params are pretty clear, they configure URL and credentials for Jenkins RM.\r\nThe prefix ones are used by Octopush to call the proper Jenkins RM job, it will concat the requested module name like: 'Push_Staging_Component1', so as to use convention over configuration.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nDiego Garber (@diego-garber), Nicolas Paez (@nicopaez), Osvaldo Toja Suarez (@osvaldotoja-olx), German Scoglio (@german-olx)\r\n \r\n### Support or Contact\r\nPlease don't hesitate to contact us\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
